# Image Segmentation Project

Welcome to the Image Segmentation Project! In this tutorial, we focus on the task of image segmentation using deep learning techniques. We'll cover data preparation, model training, evaluation, and analysis to achieve accurate segmentation results.

## Task Overview

### 1. Data Preparation
   - Download the Segmentation Dataset. Refer to the [PASCAL VOC2011 Example Segmentations](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/segexamples/index.html) to understand label structures.
   - Download the training files and split them into train, validation, and test sets.
   - Initialize [Weights & Biases (WandB)](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for experiment tracking.

### 2. Fine-tune a Segmentation Model
   - Train an [FCN ResNet50 model](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.segmentation.fcn_resnet50.html) using pre-defined network weights.
   - Use an appropriate loss function and log training progress with WandB.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set:
     - Report pixel-wise accuracy, F1-Score, IoU (Intersection Over Union), precision, recall, and average precision (AP).
     - Utilize IoUs within the range [0, 1] with a 0.1 interval size for evaluation.
   - Visualize misclassifications with IoU â‰¤ 0.5 to identify potential reasons for model failures.

### 3. Data Augmentation Techniques
   - Apply suitable data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
   - Train the segmentation model with augmented data.
   - Report performance metrics including pixel-wise accuracy, F1-Score, IoU, and AP on the test set.

### 4. Model Comparison
   - Compare and comment on the performance of different segmentation architectures.

## Highlights
- **Model Fine-tuning:** Train an FCN ResNet50 model for image segmentation.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assess model performance with pixel-wise accuracy, F1-Score, IoU, precision, recall, and AP.
- **Misclassification Analysis:** Visualize misclassified images and analyze potential reasons for model failures.
